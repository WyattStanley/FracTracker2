      <h2>1: Oil Transportation by Train</h2>
        <p>
            Virtually all oil received in Washington prior to train transportation was received by ship or pipeline.  The increased amount of oil 
            transported by trains introduces risk to the communities and environments surrounding these tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
               <li>The transportation of crude oil by train in Washington began in 2012

                <br>
               <li>The oil comes from Bakken oil fields in North Dakota, Montana, and Canada (WSDOT. pg. 76).</li> 
               <br>
               <li>Washington Dept of Transportation says, “...rail shipment has provided a quicker, more flexible alternative" (WSDOT. pg. 76).</li>

        <p>
            "While regulatory agencies and first responders have been prepared for the potential risks associated with shipping 
            oil by ship or pipeline, shipment of oil by rail presents new risks related to spills. Several explosive derailments 
            involving trains carrying Bakken oil have raised concerns about the volatility of the oil and the potential effect of 
            a derailment in Washington communities" (WSDOT. pg. 76).
            <br>
            <br>
            "A one-mile or more evacuation zone can result when there are explosions and fires involving multiple tanker cars that

      <h2>4: Spills into Waterways</h2>
        <p>
            Protecting waterways such as the Puget Sound becomes increasingly important when considering the significance of the 
            species that live within them. An oil spill could have irreversible damage on nearshore salmon habitat and resident 
            killer whale habitat.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Other threats to the health of the Puget Sound include “pulp, paper mills, oil refineries, ports, boatyards, and storm-water runoff” <a href="https://www.nwf.org/en/Magazines/National-Wildlife/2006/Orcas-on-the-Edge">(Olsen, 2022, p. 3)</a>,

             <br>
            <li>In the spring, salmon make up the entire diet of north resident killer whales <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247031">(Hanson, 2021)</a>. Oil refineries that 
                pollute salmon habitat have a direct impact on resident killer whale populations <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22096495/">(Williams, 2011)</a>.
            </li> 
             <br>
            <li>Without sufficient salmon abundance in Washington, population recovery for these whales is impossible (Hanson, 2021).</li>
             <br>
            <li>Killer whales are a cultural and historical icon to the Pacific Northwest, living together with indigenous people in 
                the Puget Sound for 5,000 years <a href="https://www.epa.gov/salish-sea/southern-resident-killer-whales">(EPA, 2023)</a>. Damaging the habitat of historically abundant food sources will
